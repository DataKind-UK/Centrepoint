##Reference geography

###What is it?
Centrepoint and its Data Ambassadors have prepared in advance to the DataDive on 17-19 July 2015 a _reference geography_. By reference geography we mean:
- the subdivision of the UK into those 381 areas that are relevant to Centrepoint's work,
- the data that describes them (names of the areas, any codes that identify them unambiguously, maps and basic characteristics such area and population), and
- basic statistics describing the youth homelessness problem in those areas.

The choice of subdivision is mainly driven by how the charity plans for its work and advocacy vs the territory, and it mostly matches the local government authorities. As a federated state, each of the four countries in the UK has its own local government arrangements and geography. The 381 Centrepoint areas are the collection of what is described below:
- in England:
  - the "single-tier" authorities
    - the 55 [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authorities_of_England)
    - the ["City of London"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Corporation) (that is not a London borough)
    - the [Isles of Scilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly)
  - the "lower-tier" authorities
    - the 201 [non metropolitan districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-metropolitan_district) (or "shires")
    - the 36 [metropolitan boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_borough)
    - the 32 [London boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs)
- in Northern Ireland, the entire country (and not its 11 [districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland))
- in Scotland, the 32 [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland) (or "councils")
- in Wales, the 22 [principal areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales) (or "counties")

Note how the real geography is actually more complicated than this! E.g. in England many districts are grouped in _councils_ and some of the data is available at council level. Thanks to the reference geography you won't need to deal with that for the basics.

###Where do I find it?
- the _uk\_centrepoint\_[some date].csv_ file includes all data but the geospatial data needed for mapping
- the _uk\_centrepoint\_[some date].json_ file includes the geospatial data but not the homelessness statistics
