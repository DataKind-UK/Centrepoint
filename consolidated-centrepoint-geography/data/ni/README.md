Northern Ireland
================
- Find the Northern Ireland 2011 Census population data by small area (SA) at http://www.nisra.gov.uk/demography/default.asp125.htm and save as the _SAPE\_SA\_01\_12.xls_ MS Excel file (NISRA doesn't do CSV).
- I could not find shapefiles for the NI local government districts, but there are shapefiles for the 2011 Census small areas (SAs) instead at [http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SmallAreas.htm](http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SmallAreas.htm), unzip them to the _SA2011\_Esri\_Shapefile_ folder. The SAs do not necessarily nest within the local government districts but a best-fit lookup table _11DC\_Lookup.xls_ can be downloaded from another page [http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SOA.htm](http://www.nisra.gov.uk/geography/SOA.htm).
